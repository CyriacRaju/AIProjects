# AIProjects
This repository contains the Artificial Intelligence Projects that I have done.

1. AIBotsVsUsers: \
    In this project, I clean and analyse the 'Users vs bots classification' dataset from Kaggle and then build a neural network model to classify bots from users. This dataset contains profile data collected from public profiles on VK.com (VKontakte), Russia's largest social network.
